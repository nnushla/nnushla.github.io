title: Week 8
---
In Week 8, we faced challenges with the data collection process with the participants as the VR system did not function. This affected our trial as we could not use our participantâ€™s data to train the system due to system failure. The VR system was also taking longer to save the sign data and we ran into other technical issues this week.  Despite these setbacks, I revised the literature review and worked on incorporating feedback from our GRA. I realized the need to provide extensive background information and make our paper more clear by adding information about the purpose and scope of this technology. Using VR to learn ASL opens doors to so many people who do not have easy access to learning ASL in a traditional classroom setting. We provided example of how a hearing parent who just had a Deaf child could learn ASL during their free time at home within the VR environment and get real time feedback through the game. I also created a list of questions to answer questions about both the technology and background of the project and made the necessary changes to the paper. This week was focused on troubleshooting and making improvisations to both the study and our paper.
