title: Week 4
---
This week was filled with productive meetings that helped us refine our research methodology and develop a deeper understanding of the project scope. Our team had several discussions with our project mentors regarding limitations and scope of the study. We also continued our extensive literature review to gather background information and identify gaps in existing research in order to revise our research questions. We were also waiting for our IRB approval to begin recruiting participants for the data collection of our maker space simulation for ASL Champ! After the sign data collection stage, we are looking into conducting usability studies by recruiting participants to gather feedback on the VR game experience. If we have enough time, we hope to conduct trials with participants using the VR learning platform to observe their interaction and learning outcomes.
