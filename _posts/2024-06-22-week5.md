title: Week 5
---
In Week 5, we completed the IRB (Institutional Review Board) application and received approval from the board to proceed with our study. During the approval process, we created the presentation of instructions for participants to help them understand the purpose of the study, how to interact with the user interface in VR and the 9 different signs for the maker space environment. After receiving the official approval, we began advertising our study across campus by putting up flyers and sharing the study to potential participants digitally. We also got one participant for our data collection the same week. I continued with the literature review revision and reviewed the project’s methodology for next week’s presentation.
