title: Week 9
---
During Week 9, I was running more participants and preparing for the results presentation. I had to present online as I was tested positive for covid. But we received the test accuracies of the sign language recognition system and compared it with the training and validation accuracy. We also collected qualitative feedback from the participants who shared their experiences with VR interaction, personal concerns and suggestions for improvisation. We were able to analyze the quantitative data and use different metrics to present the preliminary results. Both qualitative and quantitative data were helpful to assess the systemâ€™s performance and identify gaps in the model. This week was crucial for evaluating our progress and making necessary adjustments to enhance the system's accuracy and overall effectiveness.
