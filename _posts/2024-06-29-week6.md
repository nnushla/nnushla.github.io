title: Week 6
---

During Week 6, we continued our progress from week 5 and solidified our methodology. I also worked on the methodology paper draft and created powerpoint slides for the REU methodology presentation. We were concerned about the presentation because we decided to change the direction of our paper by focusing on future research possibilities and adding a comprehensive usability study. I worked on drafting a two part methodology section, one focusing on the data collection process and the other focusing on the future usability study. The data collection consisted of introduction, consent, background forms and the participants interacting with the VR interface to train the sign language recognition system. Whereas, the usability study would be more of a comparison between traditional methods of ASL learning VS learning ASL in VR and evaluating which method of learning is more effective and what improvements users would like to see.
