title: Week 7
---

During Week 7, we focused on reaching out to different programs on campus and gathering more participants for the study. We had to prepare for next weekâ€™s results presentation so recruiting more participants for the data collection process was very important. It was difficult to find a diverse range of participants as most students were not on campus over the summer and we also realized there were geographical limitations as we required participants to come in person and train our model. Meanwhile, I also assisted Dr. Lorna Quandt and Dr. Shahinur Alam to create a research grant video for ASL Champ! We provided a general overview of the project and established the purpose, objectives and main features of the game. I modeled for the demo trial for the video to demonstrate the effectiveness of the sign language recognition system and the real time feedback provided by the signing avatar in the coffee shop simulation. This week was also significant in improving our research approach and preparing for the last three weeks of REU.
