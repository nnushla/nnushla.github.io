In Week 10, I finalized the draft of our final paper, added the abstract, limitations, discussion and conclusion section. We also had the final presentation and poster session where we shared our 10 week long progress and learnings from the project. This was my first poster session and it was exciting to see everybody elseâ€™s projects and present my work alongside the REU team.
