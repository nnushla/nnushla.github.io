## About My Project

I will be working with the ASL Champ! team over the summer. I will be in assisting them to collect and train datasets to train deep learning algorithms that will power the sign recognition model in a new VR environment. 
Through this project, I will be evaluating the effectiveness of the VR-based American Sign Language (ASL) learning tool and also be addressing limitations and prospects of this research arena.
